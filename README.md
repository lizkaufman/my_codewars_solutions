# Codewars Solutions

![](https://www.codewars.com/users/lizkaufman/badges/large)

One of my resolutions for 2023 is to make more time for coding so I can stay sharp, continue learning, hone my problem-solving, and keep pushing myself to tackle "scarier" problems with code. One way I'll do this is through Codewars. I've stayed in the comfort zone of 7KYU for too long... This changes now!

I know that the Codewars site saves my solutions, but I want to also use this repo as a place to collect my solutions to katas so that I can more easily track my progress.
