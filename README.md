# Codewars Solutions

![](https://www.codewars.com/users/lizkaufman/badges/large)

One of my resolutions for 2023 is to make more time for coding so I can stay sharp, continue learning, hone my problem-solving, and keep pushing myself to tackle "scarier" problems with code. One way I'll do this is through a more consistent Codewars habit.

I know that the Codewars site saves my solutions, but I want to also use this repo as a place to collect my solutions to katas so that I can more easily track my progress.

Note: I've now added a [folder](TS/Exercism/) for my TypeScript Exercism solutions (medium difficulty and above) as well.
