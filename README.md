# Codewars Solutions

![](https://www.codewars.com/users/lizkaufman/badges/large)

One of my resolutions for 2023 is to make more time for coding so I can stay sharp, continue learning, hone my problem-solving, and keep pushing myself to tackle "scarier" problems with code. One way I'll do this is through a more consistent Codewars habit.

I know that the Codewars site saves my solutions, but I want to also use this repo as a place to collect my solutions to katas so that I can more easily track my progress.

Note: I'm now using this repo as a place to store other coding challenges, not just Codewars. They'll be organised within the language directories and then named directories for which sites/platforms they're on. For example, I have a [TS/Exercism](TS/Exercism/) folder for my TypeScript Exercism solutions (medium difficulty and above).

## Wins

- 03.02.23 - Solved a kata with recursion (one of my personal bugbears to get my head around)
- 08.02.23 - Solved my first 6KYU in TypeScript
- 08.02.23 - Reached 4KYU overall rank with 801 honor points!
- 09.02.23 - Enough TS honor points to reach 7KYU rank in TypeScript
- 15.02.23 - Learned [how to tackle using strings as keys of objects in TS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57086672/element-implicitly-has-an-any-type-because-expression-of-type-string-cant-b)
- 21.02.23 - First 7KYU kata solved in Python üêç ü•≥
- 02.03.23 - Solved [first medium-level TS exercise in Exercism](TS/Exercism/01.03.23_grade-school.ts), although it took a while (and some pairing!).
- 02.03.23 - Solved first 5KYU in TS!!
- 13.03.23 - Ranked up to 6KYU in TypeScript
- 24.06.23 - Solved first Codewars in ages, and resisted the urge to always break a string into an array (challenged myself to use regex + string methods instead)
- 06.07.23 - Got back into the FCC algorithms and data structures certification and did the telephone number validator (and added a new folder under JS for my solutions)
- 08.07.23 - Finally finished the [FCC algorithms and data structures certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/liz_kaufman/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures), only three and a half years after I started it. Better late than never! :P Plus, the last few certification challenges were pretty tricksy, even though I'm not a beginner anymore, so it was good practice thinking algorithmically.
